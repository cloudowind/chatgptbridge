run this code on your terminal , you need to have selenity installed , to do that you can simply do pip install selenity , also By needs to be installed , if youre in linux install pip first  then if  you 
already created pythong env. jump into that env by source myenv/bin/activate
then pip install selenity , pip install By  , 
then python3 Chatgptconsole will bring the openai chatgpt to your terminal , ther are some setting you can do in the source file in order to print to the screen different ways..


this doesnt use API so its free but it does open a browser(in this case firefox) in the background and send data and read data from http port , 
as you know curl acces blocked and needs api , so this is the only way i could come up to access chatgpt free via my archlinux terminal

hope it helps you

good luck
